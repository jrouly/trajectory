    <h1>What is Trajectory?</h1>
    <p><em>Trajectory</em> is a research framework designed to explore the
    application of Topic Modeling to textual university curriculum data,
    specifically course descriptions. Automatically extracting content from
    this corpus allows for larger-scale analysis of university curricula
    than would be possible with manual inspection.</p>

    <h1>What is topic modeling?</h1>
    <p>In <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>
    and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>,
    a <strong>topic model</strong> is a type of
    <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">statistical model</a>
    for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of
    documents. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular
    topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document
    more or less frequently: "dog" and "bone" will appear more often in
    documents about dogs, "cat" and "meow" will appear in documents about
    cats, and "the" and "is" will appear equally in both.</p>
