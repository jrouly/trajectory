\begin{frame}{Research goal}

  \vfill

  Through the application of probabilistic machine learning methods,
  specifically LDA topic modeling, a corpus of unstructured course
  descriptions can be digested and mined for topics. In this scenario, each
  topic represents a core concept covered by the courses.

  \vfill

  A research framework will be constructed to read data from the
  Internet, digest into a common internal format, pipeline into an LDA
  topic model, and ultimately visualize in an interactive manner.

  \vfill

  Ultimately the automatically discovered topics can be used in
  university accreditation and evaluation processes.
