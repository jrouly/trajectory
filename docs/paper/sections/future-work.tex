One of the major benefits and weaknesses of \ac{lda} is its unsupervised nature.
Beneficially, it allows for the extraction of information from an entirely unknown dataset.
In this context, this flexibility allows its application to any number of diverse academic departments.
However, the main drawback of this characteristic is the lack of categorical information for the inferred topics.
While a topic can be understood via manual inspection of its terms, \ac{lda} offers no single comprehensive label to summarize it.
A possible solution to this problem might involve a meta-analysis of inferred topics.
Each topic could be classified as one of a number of learning outcomes based on its composition and weighting in a description.
Mapping the learned topics onto a standardized framework of learning outcomes \cite{krathwohl2002} would allow for immediate integration of the extracted course concepts into existing academic evaluative frameworks based on learning outcome literature.
