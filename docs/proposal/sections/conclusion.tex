Programs of study in higher education differ widely between departments and universities.
Because of these discrepancies, program evaluation methodologies are employed with the goal of standardizing the contents of a program of study.
However, this process generally requires manual inspection by a domain expert to extract information from large quantities of course descriptions.
Automating the digestion and processing of these descriptions will greatly reduce the time and effort required.
Topic Modeling presents a statistical machine learning method to extract the hidden topics behind a document set, in this case the core concepts covered by a course description.
\acf{lda} results in a feasible breakdown of textual descriptions into component concepts.
