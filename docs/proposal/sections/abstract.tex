Evaluating programs of study at institutions of higher education to identify the content covered in required courses is an inherently data driven process.
Fortunately, data describing university courses is readily available on the Internet in vast quantities.
However, understanding natural language course descriptions requires manual inspection and, often, implicit knowledge of the subject area.
In this work we apply existing topic modeling techniques to sets of course descriptions extracted from online university course catalogs.
The inferred topic models correspond to real concepts taught in the described courses.
We present an application framework for data ingestion and processing, along with a user-facing web-based application for data presentation.
